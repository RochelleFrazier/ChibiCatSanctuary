            	<p>Chibi’s Cat Sanctuary is a facility where felines from the state of Pennsylvania are brought to have a permanent home to live and to be protected for the rest of their lives. But we also offer adoptions to certain adoptable cats. This sanctuary helps families that can no longer take care of their cats due to a death in the family, moving somewhere where felines are not allowed, and just any unwanted cats. We also accept stray and feral felines. We provide a small tour of our facility to allow residents and adopters to see what we offer our feline friends. <br> Come visit us soon!</p>

Purpose of surrender is to re-home the cats if applicable.<br>Chibi’s Cat Sanctuary offers an owner surrender program for all cats no matter the circumstances. For a small fee of $25, we will keep your feline friend and consider it for rehoming. The fee is to help us feed and provide veterinarian care for your incoming surrender feline. Chibi’s Cat Sanctuary is Harrisburg’s largest no-kill shelter. We will never euthanize an animal for space or time spent here.</p>

											<li>For many years, all longhaired cats were referred to simply as “Angoras.”</li>
											<li>All Turkish Angoras registered by CFA must be able to trace their ancestry back to Turkey.</li>
											<li>Turkish Angoras are most commonly thought of as white, but they come in many colors and patterns, including black, blue, red, cream, tortoiseshell, and classic, mackerel and spotted tabbies of many colors.</li>
											<li>An Angora in full winter coat has a mane, britches on the hind legs, and a fully plumed tail.</li>
											<li>Some Turkish Angora breeders still import cats from Turkey. A breeder advertising "imported lines" usually means they are using foundation stock from Turkey.</li>

											<li>When you look at a Bombay, you see a muscular, medium-size cat. If you were to pick him up, you would find that he is heftier than he looks.</li>
											<li>To maintain the Bombay’s body type and coat texture, breeders may occasionally outcross to Burmese, one of the Bombay’s parent breeds. Outcrosses to American Shorthairs or domestic shorthairs are rarely done because the body type is not the same. The Bombay and Burmese differ in that the Bombay is slightly larger and has a longer body and longer legs.</li>
											<li>While they reach sexual maturity early, sometimes at five months, Bombays may not complete their physical growth as far as size and muscle development until they are almost two years old.</li>
											<li>The Bombay’s nickname is “the patent-leather kid with the new-penny eyes.”</li>
